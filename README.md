W241 is a Causality and Experiments Class.  We worked on 5 assignments throughout the semester and then completed an experiment in groups of four.  Because stress levels in the USA increased in 2016, our experiment sought to address the question of: do Americans who are exposed to article summaries specifically about Trump have higher perceived stress levels than those who are exposed to news about topics other than Trump?  
 
We created a short survey with a random assignment of article headlines powered by Qualtrics, sought out a diverse population of participants, and evaluated our results.  The final paper is included along with the R code that populated much of the paper.
